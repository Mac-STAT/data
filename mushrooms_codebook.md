# Mushrooms

Source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/73/mushroom

This dataset contains descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family (pp. 500-525). The target variable is whether or not the species is poisonous (TRUE if poisonous, FALSE if edible).

Three other categorical predictors are included (note that they have been updated to use full descriptors rather than the single-character coding scheme used in the original dataset).

- `cap_shape`: (bell, conical, convex, flat, knobbed, or sunken)
- `cap_surface`: (fibrous, grooves, scaly, or smooth)
- `gill_size`: (broad or narrow)
