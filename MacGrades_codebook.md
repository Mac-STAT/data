This dataset contains a sub-sample (to help preserve anonymity) of every grade assigned to a former Macalester graduating class, between the years 1991 and 2005. For each of the 6414 rows of data, the following information is provided (with a few missing values):

-   `sessionID`: A section ID number
-   `sid`: A student ID number
-   `grade`: The grade obtained, as a numerical value (i.e. an A is a 4, an A- is a 3.67, etc.)
-   `dept`: A department identifier (these have been made ambiguous to maintain anonymity)
-   `level`: The course level (e.g. 100-, 200-, 300-, and 600-)
-   `sem`: A semester identifier
-   `enroll`: The section enrollment
-   `iid`: An instructor identifier (these have been made ambiguous to maintain anonymity)
