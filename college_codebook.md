# College

Data obtained from [Vittorio Addona's data repository](https://github.com/vittorioaddona/data) on July 8, 2024.

Dataset contains information on 195 colleges. Useful for thinking about data context, as the GradRate variable is percentage of students earning a degree in exactly 4 years, so for some colleges in the dataset this is zero.

- `School`: Name of college
- `GradRate`: Proportion of students earning a degree in 4 years (ranges from 0 to 1)
- `AdmisRate`: Admission rate; that is, the proportion of applicants admitted to the college (ranges from 0 to 1)
- `Type`: School type (private or public)
