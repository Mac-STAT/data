# College

Data obtained from [US DoE College Scorecard website](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/) on July 8, 2024. Downloaded the most recent institution-level data.

Dataset contains information on 1651 colleges in the U.S. Useful for thinking about data context, as the GradRate variable is percentage of students earning a degree in exactly 4 years, so for some colleges in the dataset this is zero. Data was cleaned by Taylor Okonek on July 8th, 2024 to only include observations with both a recorded admissions rate and graduation rate in the most recently available, institution-level data.

- `Name`: Name of college
- `Type`: School type (Public, Private nonprofit, Private for-profit)
- `GradRate`: Proportion of students earning a degree in 4 years (ranges from 0 to 1)
- `AdmisRate`: Admission rate; that is, the proportion of applicants admitted to the college (ranges from 0 to 1)
