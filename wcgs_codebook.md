# WCGS: Western Collaborative Group Study

The Western Collaborative Group Study (WCGS) was designed in order to investigate a possible link between Type A behavior and coronary heart disease (CHD), and to develop a framework to select patients for intervention in order to decrease risk of CHD. The study contained 3154 cis men between the ages of 39 and 59 in California who had no history of CHD. They were enrolled in the study in 1960 and 1961, underwent a medical examination and covered their medical history, and they were re-examined annually for interim cardiovascular history. The dataset wcgs contains information on the following variables:

* `id`: Patient identification number
* `age`: Age at time of enrollment in the study (years)
* `height`: Height at time of enrollment in the study (inches)
* `weight`: Weight at time of enrollment in the study (lbs)
* `sbp`: Systolic blood pressure
* `dbp`: Diastolic blood pressure
* `chol`: Cholesterol (mg/dL)
* `ncigs`: Number of cigarettes smoked per day
* `tabp`: Presence (1) or absence (0) of Type A behavior
* `chd`: Presence (1) or absence (0) of CHD over followup
* `typchd`: Type of CHD event (0 = none, 1 = MI or SD, 2 = silent MI, 3 = angina)
* `time`: Followup time (days)
* `arcus`: Presence (1) or absence (0) of arcus senilis
* `bmi`: Constructed variable; BMI = weight * 703 / height^2

This data was obtained in 2022 from Prof. Jim Hughes at the University of Washington, and used for a course Taylor taught in graduate school.

A popular news article on the CUT can be found [here](https://www.thecut.com/2016/08/the-tobacco-industry-helped-create-the-type-a-personality.html), which would be good to have students look at in terms of ethics!
